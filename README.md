This repository implements Fake News Detection (TFND) using Transformer models. The objective of this project is to build, train, and evaluate models capable of detecting fake news articles across multilingual datasets, utilizing state-of-the-art transformer architectures.

This work is relevant for research on misinformation detection, NLP in Indian languages, and cross-lingual transfer learning.

The model is work in progress.
